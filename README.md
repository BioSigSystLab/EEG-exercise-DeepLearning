# EEG-exercise Deep Learning
Code base for the paper titled **"Unfolding the effects of acute cardiovascular exercise on neural correlates of motor learning using Convolutional Neural Networks"**
Deep Learning to analyse effect of bout of exercise on EEG data. <br/>
Supervisors: Marie-Helene Boudrias & Georgios Mitsis <br/>
The architecure of network is influenced by [Learning to See by Moving](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.01596) paper. <br/>
A ppt presenting the method and results with intro to DL is [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_LgQYcsN1bXu424kj4oKEB9XQwO5JIpKh4Pak5bvUNM/edit?usp=sharing) <br/>
The results can be found in the Results folder. The .lua files are for training and .m files for visualising the filters or network parameters in MATLAB. The model files and data files are not uploaded here.
